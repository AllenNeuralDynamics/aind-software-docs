# Subject

Information about the subject, such as genotype, age, sex, and source is described in the `subject.json` file. 

`subject.json` files are generated by the aind data transfer service, which utilizes the metadata service to pull internal metadata information from LabTracks. If you are using a subject that is not from our animal facility, you will need to generate a `subject.json` file manually.
