# Subject

Information about the subject, such as genotype, age, sex, and source is described in the `subject.json` file. 

`subject.json` files are generated by the aind data transfer service, which utilizes the metadata service to pull internal metadata information from LabTracks. If the subject is not from the AIND animal facility, the `subject.json` file should be written manually.
