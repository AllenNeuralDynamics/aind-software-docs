# Subject

[Documentation for `subject.json`](https://aind-data-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subject.html)

`subject.json` files are generated by `aind-data-transfer-service`, which pulls internal metadata information from LabTracks.

If a subject is not from the AIND animal facility, the `subject.json` file should be written manually. You can either use the [GUI](https://metadata-entry.allenneuraldynamics.org/) or write python code that imports aind-data-schema.
