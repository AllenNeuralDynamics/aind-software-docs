# Session / Acquisition

Every data asset has a unique `session.json` or `acquisition.json` file that specifies the hardware, hardware-specific parameters (e.g. laser power), and stimuli parameters that were used during data collection. 

`session.json` is used for physiology and behavior data.  
`acquisition.json` is used for light sheet imaging.
