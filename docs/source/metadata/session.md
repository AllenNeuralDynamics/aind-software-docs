# Session / Acquisition

[Documentation for `session.json`](https://aind-data-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/procedures.html)

Every data asset has a unique `session.json` or `acquisition.json` file that specifies the hardware, hardware-specific parameters (e.g. laser power), and stimuli parameters that were used during a single episode of data collection. 

`session.json`: used for physiology and behavior data.  
`acquisition.json`: used for light sheet imaging.
