# Processing

The `processing.json` file keeps a record of the data processing and analysis steps applied to the original data asset. 

The data transfer service creates a `processing.json` file describing the data compression or other preprocessing steps that were applied to the data prior to upload. If additional processing steps are applied to the original data asset, the user should create a `processing.json` file for each derived data asset.
