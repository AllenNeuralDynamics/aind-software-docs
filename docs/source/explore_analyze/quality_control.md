# Quality control

All data assets generated at AIND should undergo automated (and sometimes manual) quality control before being used in analysis. To make this as efficient as possible we provide a standardized metadata schema for tracking quality control metrics as well as a convenient portal for reviewing QC metadata.

## Preparing QC metadata

Please see the documentation on [QualityControl](https://aind-data-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quality_control.html) for a comprehensive overview of QC.

## QC Portal

Please see the [QC Portal](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-qc-portal?tab=readme-ov-file) documentation for more information.
