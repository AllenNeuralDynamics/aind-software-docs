# Documentation Guidelines

## What 

As a developer you are responsible for providing four kinds of documentation: **tutorials** for beginners learning how to use a tool, **how-to guides** for achieving specific goals, technical **reference** for understanding software, and **explanation** for understanding why tools were built the way they are.

## Where

| Location | Type | User | Details |
|----------|------|------|---------|
| [aind-software-docs](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-software-docs)  | Tutorials | New users | User stories, tutorials, and links to technical documentation |
| Documentation page for your repository | How-to Guides | Technical users | Technical details about a library |
| README.md in your repository | Reference | Developers | Developer documentation, contributing guidelines, and deployment details |
| Talks, project proposals, white papers | Explanation | Developers | Why we did things the way we did |

## How

You can contribute directly to this repository with a pull request and review.

Libraries built using the `aind-library-template` automatically have a read-the-docs documentaiton built-in. You can write `.rst` files or add the `myst-parser` package and write `.md` files. You can deploy your documentation directly on the [read-the-docs](https://readthedocs.org).
