# About

The mission of the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics (AIND) is to answer fundamental questions about brain function. Specifically, how does our brain build our understanding of the complex world around us to guide the flexible behaviors that address our biological needs? The answers will be in terms of defined neuron types interacting across the whole brain and body, requiring us to develop next-generation neurotechnologies and employ a team-based approach for discovery neuroscience. Knowledge, data, and tools will be widely shared, in part to support the development of therapies for brain disorders. 

This mission for AIND Scientific Computing is to accelerate rigorous scientific discovery for the AIND team and our community by creating a best-in-class open, reproducible, and scalable platform for scientific data, analysis, and sharing.
