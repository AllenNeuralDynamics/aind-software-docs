# Acquire, upload & process

## I want to...

[Prepare my metadata](prepare_before_acquisition.md) before acquisition.

[Calibrate and test](calibration.md) an instrument.

[Acquire data](acquire_data.md) on an instrument.

[Upload data](upload_data.md) to the Cloud.

[Process data](process_data.md) using our per-modality standard pipelines.
