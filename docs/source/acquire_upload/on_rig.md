During data acquisition you are responsible for running version-controlled acquisition software and ensuring your data files for each modality are organized according to standardized conventions.

Metadata generated during acquisition captures **what data** should appear in the final NWB files after processing, as well as **what manipulations** were performed (both behavioral stimuli and any procedures).

## Data organization conventions

Raw data assets should be organized by modality.
