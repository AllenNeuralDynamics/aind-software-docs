# Developing Metadata

All AIND data assets must include rich metadata. The purpose of these files is to provide complete experimental details and documentation so that all users have a thorough understanding of the data.

You can learn about the metadata itself in the [aind-data-schema docs](https://aind-data-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This page is focused on helping you *develop* your metadata.

A lot of the metadata is automatically generated by the `data-transfer-service` when data is uploaded. For most users, the main pieces of metadata you are responsible for are the `rig/instrument`, `session`, `processing`, and `quality_control`. The `subject`, `data_description`, `session/acquisition`, and `procedures` are populated automatically.

### Rig / Instrument

The `rig.json` or `instrument.json` describe the hardware and software used to collect a data asset. 

### Session / Acquisition

Every data asset has a unique `session.json` or `acquisition.json` file that specifies the hardware, hardware-specific parameters (e.g. laser power), and stimuli parameters that were used during data collection. 

`session.json` is used for physiology and behavior data.  
`acquisition.json` is used for light sheet imaging. 

### Processing

The `processing.json` file keeps a record of the data processing and analysis steps applied to the original data asset. 


### Quality Control

Generating the `quality_control.json` file allows you to take advantage of the QC Portal, a SCICOMP maintained tool for querying and annotating data quality during processing and analysis.

The `quality_control.json` file should be generated or appended to at three times in a data asset's life: (1: Raw) immediately after data acquisition, (2: Processing) during processing when quality control metrics are computed, and (3: Analysis) during data analysis if further quality control is needed, for example for multi-asset quality metrics.

Detailed documentation for the QC metadata is found in the [aind-data-schema QC docs](https://aind-data-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quality_control.html), while a walkthrough for AIND users can be found in the [QC portal docs](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-qc-portal?tab=readme-ov-file#qc-portal)
