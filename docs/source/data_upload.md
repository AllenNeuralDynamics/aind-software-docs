# Data Upload to Code Ocean

We provide the `aind-data-transfer-service` to support uploading data to Code Ocean. Upload jobs can be submitted manually through a web portal or through a REST API. A full walkthrough is on the [aind-data-transfer-service docs](https://aind-data-transfer-service.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UserGuide.html).
