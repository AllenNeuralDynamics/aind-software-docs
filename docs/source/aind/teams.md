# Scientific Computing Teams

## Data Infrastructure

Data Infrastructure maintains the core services in AIND.

Some of the major core services:

**aind-data-transfer-service**

FastAPI service to run data compression and transfer jobs on the HPC

**aind-metadata-service**

REST service to retrieve metadata from AIND databases

## Data & Outreach

The Data & Outreach team is responsible for our open science. It
maintains the data schema, the metadata chatbot, and associated downstream tools and organizes and hosts workshops and other outreach events.

**aind-data-schema**

Metadata schema for neuroscience

**aind-metadata-mapper**

Repository to help gather and map metadata from different sources

[readthedoc](https://aind-metadata-mapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | [repo](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-metadata-mapper)

**aind-metadata_mcp**

MCP for querying the metadata DocDB

[repo](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-metadata-mcp)

### Outreach

**SWDB Data Book**

Data book for the SWDB course
