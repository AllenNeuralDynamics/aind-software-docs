# Acquire and upload data

## I want to...

[Prepare my metadata](acquire_upload/prepare_before_acquisition.md) before acquisition.

[Calibrate and test](acquire_upload/calibration.md) an instrument.

[Run my acquisition](acquire_upload/on_rig.md) on an instrument.

[Upload my data assets](acquire_upload/upload.md) to the Cloud.

[Process my data assets](acquire_upload/processing.md) using our per-modality standard pipelines.
